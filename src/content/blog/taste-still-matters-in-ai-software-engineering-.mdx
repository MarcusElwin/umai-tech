## Introduction: The Vibe Coding Revolution

In the age of *Generative AI* and *Large Language Models*, the landscape of software engineering and in particular AI driven software engineering is rapidly evolving. With tools like Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT, and other AI assistants, anyone can now write code, build applications, and even create complex systems. 
Then in less then one year, we have seen the rise of a plethora of so called **"vibe coding"** tools that allow users to create software by simply describing what they want in natural language. This democratization of software development has led to a surge in the number of people identifying as software engineers, with many claiming to be able to build full-stack applications with ease.

Tools like **Lovable**, **Vercel V0**, **Bolt.new**, and recent new actors such as **Leap** or **Emergent**, are making it possible for anyone to create software without traditional coding skills. This shift is not just about making coding accessible; it's about changing the very nature of how we think about software development.

The evidence is everywhere. Emergent AI hit 700,000+ users and $10M ARR in just two months with a "no developers required" platform[^3]. GitHub Copilot now serves 20 million developers, generating 20-50% of their code[^4]. Neo AI achieved a 34% medal rate on Kaggle competitions, outperforming Microsoft (22.4%) and OpenAI (16.9%) at autonomous ML engineering[^5]. And according to Y Combinator, 25% of their current batch reports that AI generates 95% of their codebase[^6].

The rise of these tools has sparked a debate about the future of software engineering. And many of these vibe coding tools seems to be really succesful such as Lovable: whom reached **$1.8 billion** valuation in just **8** months—becoming the fastest software company to achieve unicorn status in history[^1]. Are we witnessing the end of traditional coding as we know it? Will AI-driven tools replace human developers, or will they augment our capabilities, allowing us to focus on higher-level design and product intuition?

To qoute the former Tesla AI Director, Andrej Karpathy for a definition of vibe coding:
 <Callout type="info">
  **The Vibe Coding Definition**: "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and
  forget that the code even exists." — Andrej Karpathy, Former Tesla AI Director[^2]
  </Callout>

Looking at myself and my daily work, I can say that vibe coding is not just a trend; it's a fundamental shift in how we approach software development. It's about leveraging AI to enhance our creativity and intuition, rather than just writing lines of code. This new paradigm is not just about speed or efficiency; it's about creating software that resonates with users on a deeper level.

However, the question remains: **can everyone build software that not only functions but also resonates with users, sells well, and exhibits good design and taste?** We're witnessing the commoditization of code itself. What can't be commoditized—at least not yet—is the ability to sense what users actually want, to craft experiences that feel effortless, and to make the thousand micro-decisions that separate beloved products from forgotten ones. As Formation.dev puts it: "When AI can generate dozens of implementations, product thinking becomes the compass"[^8].

<Callout type="warning">
**The Great Shift**: We're witnessing the commoditization of code itself. As Google engineer Jack O'Brien notes, "virtually all new software will be
created by autonomous agents," yet "concerningly, few software engineers today truly have great taste"[^7].
</Callout>

In this post, we will explore why "taste" in software engineering is more important than ever and how it can set apart successful products from the rest. If you're a founder, engineer, or product builder wondering how to thrive when anyone can build anything, this is your guide to the skills that
  matter most in the vibe coding era.   

## From Copilots to Autonomous Coding Agents: The Evolution of AI in Software Engineering

The transformation from traditional coding to AI-assisted development hasn't happened overnight—it's unfolded in three distinct waves, each fundamentally changing how software gets built. Understanding this evolution reveals why taste and product sense have become the critical differentiators in an age where anyone can generate code.

### The Three Waves of AI-Assisted Development

The progression from simple autocomplete to autonomous coding agents represents one of the fastest technological shifts in software engineering history. Each wave built upon the previous one, gradually shifting the bottleneck from technical implementation to product vision.

Each wave represents a fundamental shift in the relationship between human developers and AI. Wave 1 made developers faster. Wave 2 made AI capable of independent work. Wave 3 democratized software creation entirely[^10]. Importantly, GitHub Copilot pioneered this space in 2021, predating even ChatGPT by over a year—proving that specialized AI tools could transform software development before general-purpose AI became mainstream.

**Why Web Traffic as Market Proxy?** In the AI development tools market, web traffic serves as a particularly strong proxy for market attention and user engagement for several key reasons:

1. **Browser-Based Development**: Unlike traditional desktop IDEs, most modern AI coding platforms are web-based applications. This means web traffic directly correlates with actual development work, not just marketing site visits or app store browsing.

2. **High-Intent Sessions**: AI coding platforms typically see 15-45 minute average session durations as users actively build, iterate, and deploy applications. This extended engagement indicates that traffic represents genuine platform usage rather than casual exploration.

3. **Iterative Workflow Patterns**: The "vibe coding" approach requires frequent back-and-forth interaction—users describe, review, modify, and refine their applications through multiple sessions. This creates consistent traffic patterns that reflect real adoption and stickiness.

4. **Developer Evaluation Behavior**: Unlike consumer apps where downloads or social metrics matter more, developers primarily evaluate coding tools through hands-on web interface testing. Traffic volume becomes a direct indicator of how many developers are actively trying and comparing platforms.

5. **Private Company Transparency Gap**: Since most platforms are venture-backed and private, detailed revenue breakdowns aren't publicly available. Web traffic provides one of the few measurable metrics for comparative analysis, especially when triangulated with disclosed funding rounds and user growth announcements.

Our methodology combines web traffic analysis (using tools like SimilarWeb and SEMrush) with publicly disclosed ARR figures, user counts from press releases, and funding valuations to create a multi-dimensional view of market position. While traffic alone isn't perfect—it doesn't capture enterprise contracts or revenue per user differences—it provides the most accessible proxy for understanding where developer attention and market momentum are flowing in this rapidly evolving space.

The market has crystallized into three distinct categories, each serving different user needs and showcasing different approaches to the taste versus technical complexity trade-off:

      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

The data reveals a clear pattern: **platforms that prioritize user experience and workflow design over pure technical capabilities are achieving unprecedented growth rates**[^11]. Lovable's journey from zero to $1.8B valuation in 8 months wasn't built on superior AI models—it was built on understanding what users actually want when they say "build me an app."

**Market Data Disclaimer**: Market share figures are estimates based on publicly available traffic data, funding announcements, and industry analysis. Actual revenue figures may vary as most companies are private. Traffic measurements may not directly correlate with usage patterns or revenue generation.
</Callout>

### The Commoditization Acceleration: From 20% to "No Developers Required"

The speed of this transformation has caught even industry experts by surprise. In just four years, we've moved from AI handling basic code completion to platforms claiming "no developers required" for complex applications.

<Callout type="warning">
**The Commoditization Reality**: GitHub Copilot went from 1 million users generating simple autocomplete to 20 million users with AI writing 20-50% of their code[^4]. Meanwhile, platforms like Emergent built 10,000+ applications in just two weeks[^3]. The mechanical act of coding is becoming a commodity faster than anyone predicted.
</Callout>

This acceleration has created what researchers call the "pit of death" problem—a point where AI-generated code becomes too complex for the AI itself to debug or extend[^12]. As one developer observed: "Things start fast and awesome... But then you start prompting more and more, and you struggle to get what you want out of it. Eventually, some prompt you use breaks everything."

**What This Means for Traditional Development:**

The implications are profound and immediate:

- **Shift from Implementation to Orchestration**: Developers are becoming AI coordinators rather than code writers
- **Product Definition Becomes Primary**: Knowing *what* to build matters more than knowing *how* to build it  
- **Prompt Engineering as Core Skill**: The ability to communicate intent to AI systems becomes crucial
- **User Experience Differentiation**: With similar technical capabilities, UX design separates winners from losers

<Callout type="success">
**The Taste Advantage**: As Formation.dev notes, "When AI can generate dozens of implementations, product thinking becomes the compass"[^8]. The platforms achieving massive growth aren't the ones with the best AI models—they're the ones with the best understanding of user workflows and needs.
</Callout>

### The Pattern: Technology Scales, Taste Doesn't

Looking across all three waves, a clear pattern emerges. Technical capabilities can be replicated and scaled through AI, but the human judgment about what users want, how interfaces should feel, and which features matter most—this remains uniquely human and becomes more valuable as everything else becomes commoditized.

The companies winning in each category—whether it's GitHub Copilot's developer-centric approach, Lovable's production-ready focus, or Cursor's premium user experience—all share one trait: they made decisions based on deep user empathy rather than technical feasibility alone. As we'll explore in the next section, this shift from technical skills to taste and product intuition represents the most significant change in software engineering since the advent of high-level programming languages.

## Digression: Brief History of Software Engineering

To understand why taste matters more than ever in the vibe coding era, we need to step back and examine how software engineering has fundamentally evolved. The journey from traditional programming to today's generative AI platforms represents three distinct paradigm shifts—each changing not just how we build software, but what it means to be a software engineer.

### The Three Software Paradigms: From Instructions to Intentions

The evolution of software engineering can be understood through three major paradigms, each representing a fundamental shift in how we create and interact with software systems. These paradigms didn't simply replace each other—they layered on top of one another, creating increasingly sophisticated abstractions while making certain skills obsolete and others more critical.

### The Pattern: From Technical Skills to Human Judgment

Each paradigm shift follows a consistent pattern: **technical complexity gets abstracted away, while human judgment becomes more critical**. This isn't just a coincidence—it's the fundamental trajectory of technological progress.

**Software 1.0 → 2.0: The First Abstraction**
- **What became commoditized**: Writing basic algorithms and data structures
- **What became critical**: Understanding data, statistics, and machine learning theory
- **Skills that emerged**: Data science, ML engineering, statistical modeling

**Software 2.0 → 3.0: The Second Abstraction**  
- **What became commoditized**: Training models and understanding ML theory
- **What became critical**: Prompt engineering, product intuition, and user experience design
- **Skills that emerged**: AI orchestration, prompt engineering, vibe coding

**Software 3.0 → 4.0: The Coming Abstraction**
- **What will be commoditized**: Code generation and prompt engineering
- **What will become critical**: Goal setting, taste, and human-AI collaboration
- **Skills that will emerge**: AI alignment, taste curation, system orchestration

<Callout type="insight">
**The Taste Trajectory**: As each layer of technical complexity gets automated, the skills that remain are increasingly about human judgment, aesthetic sense, and understanding what users actually want. We're moving from "how to build it" to "what should be built" and "does this feel right?"
</Callout>

### Why Software 3.0 Changes Everything

The shift to Software 3.0 represents the most dramatic change in software engineering since the invention of high-level programming languages. For the first time in computing history, **the primary bottleneck is no longer technical knowledge—it's taste**.

Consider the implications:

1. **Democratization at Scale**: Anyone can now build functional software by describing what they want
2. **Technical Skills Commodity**: Knowing syntax, frameworks, and even architectural patterns matters less
3. **Taste as Differentiator**: The ability to sense what users want becomes the primary competitive advantage
4. **Speed vs. Quality Tension**: Rapid iteration is possible, but maintaining quality requires human judgment

<Callout type="warning">
**The Convergence Problem**: When everyone can build software, the challenge shifts from "Can we build it?" to "Should we build it?" and "How do we make it exceptional?" This is where taste becomes the ultimate differentiator.

### Software 4.0: The Autonomous Era (Speculation)

Looking ahead, Software 4.0 will likely emerge when AI systems can autonomously handle the entire software lifecycle—from understanding user needs to deploying and maintaining applications. In this era:

- **AI agents** will collaborate to build and maintain complex software ecosystems
- **Human role** will shift to high-level goal setting and taste curation  
- **Success metrics** will focus on user satisfaction and goal alignment rather than technical performance
- **The ultimate skill** will be the ability to guide AI systems toward outcomes that resonate with human values and preferences

The companies and individuals who thrive in this future won't be those with the best AI models—they'll be those with the best taste for what humans actually want.

### Implications for Today's Engineers

Understanding this evolution helps explain why the skills that matter most are changing rapidly:

**Declining in Value:**
- Memorizing APIs and syntax
- Deep framework knowledge  
- Complex algorithm implementation
- Low-level optimization techniques

**Increasing in Value:**
- Product intuition and user empathy
- Design thinking and aesthetic judgment
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Ability to evaluate and curate AI-generated outputs

**Future-Critical Skills:**
- AI orchestration and prompt engineering
- Human-computer interaction design
- Goal setting and outcome definition
- Taste development and curation

The next section explores what "taste" actually means in the context of software engineering and why it has become the most important skill for the vibe coding era.
