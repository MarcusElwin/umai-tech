## Introduction
Imagine a world where your online shopping experience is not just about browsing products, but about having an intelligent agent that understands your *preferences*, anticipates your *needs*, and makes purchasing decisions on your behalf. 
This is the promise of **Agentic Commerce**, a concept that is set to revolutionize the way we interact with e-commerce platforms. In the near future, when you read this post (2025), your **AI assistant** of choice might have already negotiated a **15%** discount on your weekly grocery order, rescheduled a delayed delivery to match your calendar, and pre-ordered that sold-out gadget you mentioned wanting—all while you slept
It might sound like science fiction, but the *foundations* of this new era are already being laid.

The agentic commerce market is exploding from **$5.1 billion** in 2024 to a projected **$136 billion** by 2025, reaching an astounding **$1.7 trillion** by 2030[^1][^2]. This isn't just growth—it's a complete reimagining of how commerce works.

Since the dawn of **e-commerce** in the 1990s, the landscape has been rapidly evolving. From simple online storefronts to complex AI-driven systems, the way we shop is changing. But what we're witnessing now is unprecedented—three powerful forces are converging to create this revolution:

I predict that because of artificial intelligence and its ability to automate certain tasks that in the past have required human intuition, by far the greatest breakthroughs will come by bringing human and artificial intelligence together.
